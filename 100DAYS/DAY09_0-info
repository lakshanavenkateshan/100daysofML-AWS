ðŸ”¹ Day 9 â€” Breast Cancer (Colab + S3 + Training + Save Model)

ðŸ”¹ What you did / goal
Run the entire ML pipeline on Google Colab, but keep the dataset and model fully in AWS S3.
This combines free Colab compute with cloud data storage.

ðŸ”¹ Why We Did This

Flexibility â†’ Even if you donâ€™t have EC2 running, you can still use Colab for ML.

Hybrid workflow â†’ Dataset + model in AWS, training in Colab.

Skill practice â†’ Using boto3 in Colab to access S3 directly.

Consistency â†’ Same workflow as Day 6/8, but now in Colab environment.

ðŸ”¹ Steps You Followed

Opened Google Colab.

Installed and configured AWS credentials (boto3, awscli) inside Colab.

Downloaded breast cancer dataset from S3 into Colab using boto3.

Code: Refer DAY09

Preprocessed dataset (mapped malignant/benign, filled missing values, etc.).

Code: Refer DAY09

Trained Random Forest classifier on breast cancer dataset.

Evaluated accuracy on test data (train/test split).

Code: Refer DAY09

Saved model as breast_cancer_rf_model.pkl with joblib.

Uploaded trained model back to S3 using boto3.

Code: Refer DAY09

ðŸ”¹ Deliverables

Notebook: day09_breast_cancer_colab.ipynb

Dataset & model remain in S3 (cloud storage).

Model trained on Colab compute.

Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC (depending on what you measured).

âœ… With this, you now have 3 different setups for ML training:

Day 6 â†’ Local + S3

Day 8 â†’ EC2 + S3

Day 9 â†’ Colab + S3

Thatâ€™s a full hybrid cloud ML workflow!
