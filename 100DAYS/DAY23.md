# Day 23/100 - Machine Learning + AWS + DevOps Journey

##  Preparing Fashion-MNIST Model for Deployment

###  Goal:
Take my trained **Fashion-MNIST Logistic Regression** model and make it ready for **AWS ECS deployment**.

###  What I Did:
- Trained and saved a **Logistic Regression model** for **10-class clothing classification**  
- Built a **Flask API** to serve predictions from new image inputs  
- Tested the API locally with **sample Fashion-MNIST images** (Predicted vs Actual)  
- Planned the next step â†’ **Dockerize & deploy** the API on **AWS ECS**

---

###  Why I Did This:
I wanted to bridge the gap between **Machine Learning and DevOps (MLOps)**.  
Building and testing a local API helps me understand how to **serve real-time ML predictions**,  
which is an essential step before deploying to a **cloud production environment** like AWS ECS.

###  Tech Stack:
- **Python**
- **Flask**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **AWS ECS (planned)**
